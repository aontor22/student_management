# student_management
A module design with Odoo 18

Make a custom-addons folder in the Odoo 18 server folder, and then paste the student_management module in that folder.
Then make a copy of the odoo.conf file and named it odoo-copy.conf. Then edit the odoo.conf with the necessary things that we need, and remove the rest
Then copy the path of the custom-addons folder and paste it into the odoo.conf file's addons_path variable separated by a comma.
Check if the interpreter is the odoo18/python/python.exe and save the config with this interpreter. Otherwise, it will not work.
Then run the module.
